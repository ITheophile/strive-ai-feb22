            <p class="card-text">My name is <span>Theo</span>phile Ishimwe. I'm very passionate about <span>Machine Learning</span> and amazed at how it's transforming many aspects of your lives.
                Because I don't want to only use ML applications, but also be on the side of those who build those amazing
                technologies, I decided to enrolled as an AI Student at Strive School, now 
                <a href="https://epicode.com/" target="_blank">Epicode</a>. I'got a Master degree in Soil Sciences as well as a Bachelor degree in 
            Geosciences.</p>
